3D-printed laboratory devices can enable ambitious research purposes even at a low-budget level. To follow this trend, here we describe the construction, calibration, and usage of the FINDUS (Fully Integrable Noncommercial Dispensing Utility System). We report the successful 3D printing and assembly of a liquid-handling workstation for less than $400. Using this setup, we achieve reliable and flexible liquid-dispensing automation with relative pipetting errors of less than 0.3%. We show our system is well suited for several showcase applications from both the biology and chemistry fields. In support of the open-source spirit, we make all 3D models, assembly instructions, and source code available for free download, rebuild, and modification.
